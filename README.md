## The interplay of gut microbiota between donors and recipients determines the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation
### Our main findings include: 
* the congruence of gut microbiota dysbiosis shared by CDI and IBD can be used to characterize and differentiate patients, who are classified into two common enterotypes, RCPT/E (dark red) and RCPT/B (orange).
* recipients with different enterotypes exhibited strong donor preference in FMT, with DONOR/P being more suitable for RCPT/B, particularly in IBD.
* we proposed a novel measure, engraftment ratio, to quantify the engraftment of donor-derived bacteria in recipient, which is significantly linked to FMT outcomes and scalable for metagenomic datasets.
* we constructed an enterotype-based donor selection (EDS) model for donor-recipient matching with AUROC > 0.8.

In the folder "analysis_code_Rmd", we provided pure code of our analyses, which is suitable to read online.  
In the folder "analysis_figures_Rnotebook", we provided PDF and HTML versions of our analysis to make it easier to understand our analyses with the output and figures. It is best to download the raw file, and read it with a PDF reader or browser.
